**Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?**

The DriverPass project is an initiative to design and develop a comprehensive system for managing online and on-the-road driver training. The client is Liam, the owner of DriverPass. He wanted a system that would enable users to take online classes, practice tests, and make reservations for driving lessons. The system also needed to accommodate different roles within the company, provide access to data from various devices, and allow for tracking of user activity.

**What did you do particularly well?**

I was able to collect requirements from the client, understand their needs, and ensure that I covered all aspects of the desired system. I tried to understand carefully to what the client wanted. I made sure that I understood all the details about the new system they wanted us to make. This helped us create a good plan for the project.

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**

I could refine the scheduling and task distribution phase. While we managed to outline the timeline and assign tasks, we could have better accounted for potential delays or roadblocks. Improvement could come from integrating buffer times and building contingencies into the plan.

**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**

User needs were interpreted through comprehensive discussion and requirement gathering sessions with the client. We then translated these needs into specific system functionalities and features. It's vital to consider user needs because the success of the system depends on how well it meets those needs. A system that isn't user-friendly or doesn't provide the desired services will not be effective or successful.

**How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?**

When we design software, we start by talking to the user to understand what they want. Then, we draw out plans and design the look of the software. We also create rules for how the software is used. In the future, we plan to use more tools and methods to make and test the software more quickly.
